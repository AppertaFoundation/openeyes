	I recently invited you to telephone to arrange a date for your admission for surgery under the care of
	<?php 
		if($consultant = $firm->getConsultant()) {
			$consultantName = $consultant->contact->title . ' ' . $consultant->contact->first_name . ' ' . $consultant->contact->last_name;
		} else {
			$consultantName = 'CONSULTANT';
		}
	?>
	<?php echo CHtml::encode($consultantName) ?>.
