## Installs and configures additional packages needed to build openeyes components
## In a docker environment, these can be installed on the developer machine to
## support running of the various oe-* helper scripts and for building eyedraw, etc.

## This script should work natively in debian based linux or Ubuntu on Windows
## Subsystem for Linux environments. Alternative scripts will be made available for
## MacOS and native Windows environments

## NOTE: This script assumes it is in protected/scripts. If you move it then relative paths will not work!

done
# Determine root folder for site - all relative paths will be built from here
