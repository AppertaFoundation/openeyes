# NOTE is is recommended to run `docker-compose down` before `docker-compose up` This will ensure that the database is refreshed on each run.
# E.g, docker-compose down && docker-compose up
#
# To see individual logs - use docker-compose logs [phpunit | behat ]
#
# To run only a single test suite, use `docker-compose up [phpunit | selenium behat ]
## Note that the selenium service is needed for the behat service
#
# If you want to view the selenium tests runing, connect a vnv viewer to localhost
