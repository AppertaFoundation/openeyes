# NOTE is is recommended to run `docker-compose down` before `docker-compose up` This will ensure that the database is refreshed on each run.
# E.g, docker-compose down && docker-compose up
#
# To see individual logs - use docker-compose logs [db | web ]
#
## Note that an xvfb service service is needed for the cypress tests
#
#
## If you want to run this file locally (e.g, to mimic the CI environment)
# 1. Make sure to delete the following local directories first:
#    - ./protected/files
#    - ./node_modules
#    - ./protected/modules/eyedraw
#    - ./protected/runtime/cache
#    - ./assets
#    ( a helper script is provided alongside this compose file named clear-assets-before-tests.sh )
# 2. [Optional, probably not needed unless you have trouble with cy:open] Set a local environment variable for display to match your local XWindows server
#    - e.g., `export DISPLAY="host.docker.internal:0"
