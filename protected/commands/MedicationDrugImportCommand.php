Import data from various different data sources into the Medication Drug model. Implemented initially to provide support
for importing medication drugs from the DM+D dataset. Specifically, the XML vtm and vmp files.

Note, the import can be run multiple times without duplicating entries, because there is a unique constraint on the
external_code, and external_source attributes of the medication_drug table. This means that updates from the DM+D dataset
can easily be applied by running the same import.

Options:
type - The type of data being imported - currently supports vtm or vmp
external_source - the name of the source data, any string, defaults to dmd (up to different installations to be consistent)
import_size - the number of rows that will be batch inserted at one time, defaults to 20.
filter_list - array of words from drug names that should be filtered out from the import (only supported by vmp import).

Usage:

./yiic medicationdrugimport [options] import [datafile]

EOH;
    }

    public $defaultAction = 'import';

    public $type = 'vtm';
    public $external_source = 'dmd';
    public $import_size = 20;

    public function actionImport($args)
    {
        $filename = $args[0];
        if (!$filename) {
            $this->usageError('Import filename required');
        }

        if (!file_exists($filename)) {
            $this->usageError('Cannot find import file '.$filename);
        }

        $mdi = new MedicationDrugImport();
        $mdi->import($filename, $this->type, $this->external_source, $this->import_size);
    }
