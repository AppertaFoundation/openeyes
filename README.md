# Description 
OpenEyes is a collaborative, open source, project led by the Apperta Foundation (http://openeyes.apperta.org). The goal is to produce a framework which will allow the rapid, and continuous development of an electronic patient record (EPR for ophthalmology in particular and eye care in general). Clinical and technical contributions are made by Hospitals, Institutions, Academic departments, Companies, and Individuals.

The initial focus is on Ophthalmology, but the design is sufficiently flexible to be used for any clinical specialty.

Ophthalmic units of any size, from a single practitioner to a large eye hospital, should be able to make use of the structure, design, and code to produce a functional, easy to use EPR at minimal cost. By sharing experience, pooling ideas, and distributing development effort, it is expected that the range and capability of OpenEyes will evolve rapidly. OpenEyes should also be of value for use by non-medical staff such as optometrists in the delivery of shared programs of eye care.
